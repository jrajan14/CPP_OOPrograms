# C++ Object Oriented Programs for Learners
## For New Learners

These are very simple C++ programs to understand Object Oriented concepts for anyone who just started learning C++ and have completed the [C++ Basic Programs](https://github.com/jrajan14/CPP_Basic_Programs) training.
Anyone who already learnt Basic C++ or even C-Language can learn and understand Object Oriented Concepts easily.

You will understand everything better after attending my training sessions.
Various comments are mentioned throughout the code to explain it better.

## Error Handling in Visual Studio

If the project shows Error (MSBuild error MSB8020) in Visual Studio, 
You may upgrade to the current Visual Studio tools by selecting the 
Project menu and then selecting "Retarget solution".

Choose the latest version, the code will compile in most versions.
